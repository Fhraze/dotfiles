# Fhraze's RiverWM dotfiles

I've included an installation script for arch-based distros with yay, it will install all needed packages and do the configuration stuff for you. When the script finishes, simply run "river" on a tty.
(OBS: THE INSTALLATION SCRIPTS REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE YAY INSTALLED)

#### Known Incompatibilities
Unfortunately the eww widgets and bar won't work well on displays with an aspect ratio different from 16:9. May work on 4k and 8k displays, but I haven't tested it yet.

#### Packages required:
- river
- thunar
- audacious
- grim
- slurp
- wl-clipboard
- dunst
- eww-wayland
- terminator
- wofi
- wofi-emoji
- playerctl
- fastfetch
- swaybg
- ripgrep
- fd
- eza
- pipewire
- pipewire-pulse
- wireplumber
(Those are Arch packages, may be different depending on your distro)

# Fhraze's RiverWM dotfiles

### Credits to [end-4](https://github.com/end-4) for the osu! themed [eww bar](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/tree/archive/hybrid/.config/eww)

**Install Sh:** I've included an installation script for arch-based distros with yay, it will install all needed packages and do the configuration stuff for you. When the script finishes, simply run "river" on a tty.
_(OBS: THE INSTALLATION SCRIPTS REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE YAY INSTALLED)_

#### Known Incompatibilities
Unfortunately the eww widgets and bar won't work well on displays with an aspect ratio different from 16:9. May work on 4k and 8k displays, but I haven't tested it yet.

- thunar
- audacious
- grim
